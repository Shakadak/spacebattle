<- EnumDirection ----------------------------------------------------------------------
EnumDirection is a replacement to the missing enum structure, using the following
constants:
NORTH
SOUTH
EAST
WEST
LEFT
RIGHT

Not that {LEFT, RIGHT} should not be used against {NORTH, SOUTH, WEST, EAST}
as it may lend unexpected result;
The constant may only be called using the class, with the scope resolution operator.
